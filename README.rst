Bluesky Browser
***************

A library of Qt widgets for searching saved bluesky data and viewing document
streams either live or from disk.

This is a prototype that may be fully rewritten, abandoned, or moved into other
libraries.

Launching the demo
==================

Clone and install.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/NSLS-II/bluesky-browser
   cd bluesky-browser
   pip install -e .

.. code-block:: bash

   bluesky-browser --demo

The above generates example data in a temporary directory and launches a Qt
application to browse that data.
